# CIST4B1_AdvJava

# About Me
I'm a student preparing to transfer next fall with an intended major in robotics.
I have experience working with electrical and mechanical systems. 
I'm not a fan of programming but one of my goals is to build my own robot something like the BDX droid "Grek" from NVIDIA, so I want to become more familiar with this subject. 

# Goals for This Course
My goal is to improve my programming skills. I want to build a strong foundation that I can use in my upper engineering courses or future projects in robotics.
