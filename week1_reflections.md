# Week 1 Reflections
## Reviewed Object Oriented Programming
- Variables store data such as, numbers, strings, characters, and arrays.
- Objects store data and behaviors (methods)
## Object Oriented Programming
- Encapsulation: Keeps data inside a class and controls how it is accessed from outside.
- Inheritance: Child classes can inherit variables and methods from parent classes.
- A class can't inherit from more than one class due to issues like the diamond problem.
- Interfaces are not classes and are used differently.
## Acccess Modifiers
- Public: Accessible from anywhere.
- Protected: Accessible within the same package and by child classes.
- Private: Accessible only within the same class.
## Data Structures
- Used to organize data in a program.
- Help make programs more efficient and easier to understand.
## Algorithms
- A set of step by step instructions to solve a problem. "Content recommendation algorithms"
- They are not tied to a specific programmming language.
- Efficiency matters because computers have limited resources.
